synopsis: A flash-cards memorization tool.
description: "A flash-cards memorization tool.

Babel Cards is a flash-cards memorization tool like Anki,
but, the author hopes, without its shortcomings.

Whereas Anki stores behavior specifications in cards, limiting
the usage of sets of cards and demanding duplication of the same
data set, Babel Cards will instead separate behavior out so you
can mix-and-match card decks and application behavior.

Whereas Anki's data model is painful for power users, Babel Cards
will use native database representations whenever possible and
not store serialized objects in text columns. The user's data
belongs to the user, and should be usable to the user even in the
absence of the application that created it.
